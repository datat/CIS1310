			information from a third party that provides automated fraud detection services to Chiave.

			You can control how much of your information social media websites make public by visiting 
			these websites and changing your privacy settings.

		<p>	
			We may share the information that we collect, both personal and non-personal, with third 
			parties such as advertisers, contest sponsors, promotional and marketing partners, and 
			others who provide our content or whose products or services we think may interest you. 
			We may also share it with our current and future affiliated companies and business partners, 
			and if we are involved in a merger, asset sale or other business reorganization, we may also 
			share or transfer your personal and non-personal information to our successors-in-interest.
		</p>
		<p>	
			We may engage trusted third party service providers to perform functions and provide services 
			to us, such as hosting and maintaining our servers and the website, database storage and 
			management, e-mail management, storage marketing, credit card processing, customer service 
			and fulfilling orders for products and services you may purchase through the website. We will 
			likely share your personal information, and possibly some non-personal information, with these 
			third parties to enable them to perform these services for us and for you.
		</p>
		<p>	
			We may share portions of our log file data, including IP addresses, for analytics purposes with 
			third parties such as web analytics partners, application developers, and ad networks. If your 
			IP address is shared, it may be used to estimate general location and other technographics such

			enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or

			How Do We Use Your Email Address?
		</p>
		<p>	
			By submitting your email address on this website, you agree to receive emails from us. You can 
			cancel your participation in any of these email lists at any time by clicking on the opt-out 
			link or other unsubscribe option that is included in the respective email. We only send emails 
			to people who have authorized us to contact them, either directly, or through a third party. 
			We do not send unsolicited commercial emails, because we hate spam as much as you do. By 
			submitting your email address, you also agree to allow us to use your email address for customer 
			audience targeting on sites like Facebook, where we display custom advertising to specific 
			people who have opted-in to receive communications from us. Email addresses submitted only 
			through the order processing page will be used for the sole purpose of sending you information 
			and updates pertaining to your order. If, however, you have provided the same email to us 
			through another method, we may use it for any of the purposes stated in this Policy. Note:

		<p>	
			How Long Do We Keep Your Information?
		</p>
		<p>	
			We keep your information only so long as we need it to provide Chiave to you and fulfill 
			the purposes described in this policy. This is also the case for anyone that we share your 
			information with and who carries out services on our behalf. When we no longer need to use 
			your information and there is no need for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory 
			obligations, we’ll either remove it from our systems or depersonalize it so that we can't 
			identify you.
			
		</p>
		<p>	
			How Do We Protect Your Information?
		</p>
		<p>	
			We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information 
			when you place an order or enter, submit, or access your personal information. We offer the use 
			of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket 
			Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our Payment gateway providers database only to 
			be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required 
			to keep the information confidential. After a transaction, your private information (credit 
			cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) is never kept on file. We cannot, however, 
			ensure or warrant the absolute security of any information you transmit to Chiave or guarantee 
			that your information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed 
			by a breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
			
		</p>
		<p>	
			Could my information be transferred to other countries?
		</p>
		<p>	
			Chiave is incorporated in United States. Information collected via our website, through 
			direct interactions with you, or from use of our help services may be transferred from 
			time to time to our offices or personnel, or to third parties, located throughout the 
			world, and may be viewed and hosted anywhere in the world, including countries that 
			may not have laws of general applicability regulating the use and transfer of such data. 
			To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, by using any of the above, you voluntarily
			consent to the trans-border transfer and hosting of such information.
			
		</p>
		<p>	
			Is the information collected through the Chiave Service secure?
		</p>
		<p>	
			We take precautions to protect the security of your information. We have physical, electronic, 
			and managerial procedures to help safeguard, prevent unauthorized access, maintain data 
			security, and correctly use your information. However, neither people nor security systems 
			are foolproof, including encryption systems. In addition, people can commit intentional 
			crimes, make mistakes or fail to follow policies. Therefore, while we use reasonable 
			efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 
			If applicable law imposes any non-disclaimable duty to protect your personal information, 
			you agree that intentional misconduct will be the standards used to measure our compliance 
			with that duty.
			
		</p>
		<p>	
			Can I update or correct my information?
		</p>
		<p>	
			The rights you have to request updates or corrections to the information Chiave collects 
			depend on your relationship with Chiave. Personnel may update or correct their information 
			as detailed in our internal company employment policies.
		</p>
		<p>	
			Customers have the right to request the restriction of certain uses and disclosures of 
			personally identifiable information as follows. You can contact us in order to (1) update 
			or correct your personally identifiable information, (2) change your preferences with 
			respect to communications and other information you receive from us, or (3) delete the 
			personally identifiable information maintained about you on our systems (subject to the 
			following paragraph), by cancelling your account. Such updates, corrections, changes and 
			deletions will have no effect on other information that we maintain, or information that 
			we have provided to third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy prior to such 
			update, correction, change or deletion. To protect your privacy and security, we may take 
			reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before 
			granting you profile access or making corrections. You are responsible for maintaining 
			the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.
		</p>
		<p>	
			You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every 
			record of the information you have provided to us from our system. The need to back up 
			our systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your information
			 may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate. 
			 Promptly after receiving your request, all personal information stored in databases we 
			 actively use, and other readily searchable media will be updated, corrected, changed or 
			 deleted, as appropriate, as soon as and to the extent reasonably and technically practicable.
			</p>
			<p>	
			If you are an end user and wish to update, delete, or receive any information we have about 
			you, you may do so by contacting the organization of which you are a customer.
			
		</p>
		<p>	
			Personnel
		</p>
		<p>	
			If you are a Chiave worker or applicant, we collect information you voluntarily provide 
			to us. We use the information collected for Human Resources purposes in order to administer 
			benefits to workers and screen applicants.

			You may contact us in order to (1) update or correct your information, (2) change your 
			preferences with respect to communications and other information you receive from us, or 
			(3) receive a record of the information we have relating to you. Such updates, corrections, 
			changes and deletions will have no effect on other information that we maintain, or 
			information that we have provided to third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy
			prior to such update, correction, change or deletion.

			Corporate Affiliates to which the Service relates, or in the event that we discontinue

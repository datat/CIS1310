			<h1 style="text-align: center;">About Us</h1>
			<p>
			<span style="font-style:italic">Chiave Essentials</span> is my new brand of manly 
			handcrafted &#38; hand cut soaps inspired by my 
			husband, male friends and by nature. Chiave soaps are made with high quality, 
			natural and pure ingredients.
			</p>
			<p>
			Things are still in the works; nevertheless, I want to start sharing this 
			journey with you. Though things are a little slow right now, I have created 
			a new IG account for my soap business, and I would love to see you there 
			@chiave_essentials.
			</p>
			<p>
			I am so happy I get to share this news with you, and can't wait to see what 
			the future holds.  
			</p>
			<p>
			One more thing, I can’t get enough of Chiave Essentials logo. 
			The logo was created by talented @benloizstudio. Ben took note of 
			everything I envision for my soap business and that’s exactly what he delivered. 
			He not only cared for everything that was related to my business as much as 
			I did, he delivered a brand identity &#38; logo I fell in love with. Make sure 
			to go check out his work at @benloizstudio.
			</p>
			<p>
			Much love ❤️ Nathalia

				My goal in my soap business is to provide handcrafted (cold process) soaps for men; 
				nevertheless, ladies you are going to love them too. I use all the soaps I make.
				</p>
				<p>
				Chiave soaps will be made with high quality ingredients that are 100% natural while 
				using essential oils that are 100%  pure. Chiave will provide a soap that will 
				enhance, help &#38; promote a healthier skin care routine for my customers.
				</p>
				<p>
				In addition, Chiave’s customers will be able to customize their soaps to meet 
				their skin care needs (stay tuned for more about how to order).
				</p>
				<p>
				I want my audience to become more aware about the soaps they are using. Most of 
				us have learned to pay attention to what we put in our bodies, but often don’t pay attention to what we put ON our bodies.
				</p>
				<p>
				When I make soaps, that is something that is my priority…my soaps will be ones 
				that my audience’s bodies will benefit from.
				</p>
				<p>
				I am happy you are here with me on this journey.
				</p>
				<p>
				If you have any questions please feel free to Contact Us or DM.

			<h2 style="text-align: center;">Our Mission</h2>
			<p>
			Our mission is to create products that are of the highest quality while 
			also being ethical, 
			eco-friendly, and health-conscious. 
			</p>

			<h2 style="text-align: center;margin-top:2em;">Our Products</h2>
			<h4>Plant-based</h4>
			<p>
			We use only plant-derived ingredients in our products. You don’t need to be vegan to 
			love our soap, but if you are, then this is the soap for you.
			</p>
			<h4>Cruelty-free</h4>
			<p>
			We don’t test our products on animals.
		</p>
			<h4>Handcrafted</h4>
			<p>
			Every one of our products is made by hand in small batches. 
			</p>
			<h4>Sustainably sourced</h4>
			<p>
			We source our palm oil from members of the Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil (rspo.org), 
			which has strict standards that protect forests, wildlife, and indigenous people while 
			minimizing pollution and providing fair working conditions and wages to farmers. Every 
			ounce of oil is traceable to the farm where it was grown. Woodberry is dedicated to 
			palm oil as a high-quality ingredient and to ensuring every drop is sustainably and 
			ethically produced.
			</p>
			<h4>Free of sulfate, phthalate, paraben, and detergent</h4>
			<p>
			What is this stuff anyway? These harmful chemicals have no place in good soap, 
			which is why you won’t find them at Chiave.
			</p>
			<h4>Scented with pure essential Oils</h4>
			<p>
			We only use essential oils to scent our products. These are steam-distilled pure 
			plant extracts, meaning that they come from the ground and not from a test tube. 
			The plants are minimally processed to release their pure essence, and retain 
			the natural smell and flavor of their source. We never use fragrance oils, 
			which are highly processed products that can contain synthetic chemicals that 
			can irritate the skin and pose certain health risks.
			</p>
			<h4>Colored by Nature</h4>
			<p>
			Our soaps are colored with a variety of clays, activated charcoal, plant pigments, 
			and natural minerals. Some of our essential oils can also affect the color of the soap.
			</p>
			<h4>Recyclable</h4>
			<p>
			More than one billion plastic body-wash bottles enter the waste system each year. 
			With our biodegradable and plastic-free packaging and bar soaps, we are glad to 
			help you reduce your dependence on single-use plastics.

			<h3>Making Handmade Soap</h3>
			<p>One of my favorite things to do while I’m making soaps...
				I love to look for the best essential oil blends for my soap scents. 
				Here I’m blending patchouli, orange &#38; ginger.

			<h2>Welcome to Chiave Essentials!</h2>

				Chiave means "key" in Italian, and we strive to be a key to 
				achieve healthier skin in your daily hygiene routine.</h3>

				<p>Chiave Essentials is your key to manly soaps that are inspired by nature. Handcrafted and hand 
				cut soaps made with love, high quality, natural and pure ingredients. 
				<span id="more">More...</span>

				<p>
				My goal in my soap business is to provide handcrafted (cold process) soaps for men; 
				nevertheless, ladies you are going to love them too. I use all the soaps I make.
				</p>
				<p>
				Chiave soaps will be made with high quality ingredients that are 100% natural while 
				using essential oils that are 100%  pure. Chiave will provide a soap that will 
				enhance, help &#38; promote a healthier skin care routine for my customers.
				</p>
				<p>
				In addition, Chiave’s customers will be able to customize their soaps to meet 
				their skin care needs (stay tuned for more about how to order).
				</p>
				<p>
				I want my audience to become more aware about the soaps they are using. Most of 
				us have learned to pay attention to what we put in our bodies, but often don’t pay attention to what we put ON our bodies.
				</p>
				<p>
				When I make soaps, that is something that is my priority…my soaps will be ones 
				that my audience’s bodies will benefit from.
				</p>
				<p>
				I am happy you are here with me on this journey.
				</p>
				<p>
				If you have any questions please feel free to Contact Us or DM.

			<h2>Benefits</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<details>
					<summary><span>Scented with Pure Essential Oils</span></summary>
					<p>Many of our soaps use essential oils to scent them. 
						Essential oils are steam-distilled pure 
						plant extracts, not chemically manufactured.  
						The plants are minimally processed to release their pure essence, and retain 
						the natural smell and flavor of their source. Essential oils are good 
						for your body and help set
						your mood.				
					</p></details>
				</li>
				<li>
					<details>
					<summary><span>Plant-Based</span></summary>
					<p>We use only plant-derived ingredients in our products. You don’t 
						need to be vegan to 
						love our soap.
					</p></details>
				</li>
				<li>
					<details>
					<summary><span>Colored by Nature</span></summary>
					<p>Our soaps are colored with a variety of clays, activated charcoal, plant pigments, 
						and natural minerals. Some of our essential oils can also affect the color of the soap.
					</p>
					</details>
				</li>
				<li>
					<details>
					<summary><span>Handcrafted</span></summary>
					<p>Every one of our products is made by hand in small batches. 
					</p>
					</details>
				</li>
				<li>
					<details>
					<summary><span>Recyclable</span></summary>
					<p>More than one billion plastic body-wash bottles enter the waste system each year. 
						With our biodegradable and plastic-free packaging and bar soaps, we are glad to 
						help you reduce your dependence on single-use plastics.						
					</p>
					</details>
				</li>
				<li>
					<details>
					<summary><span>Sustainably Sourced</span></summary>
					<p>We source our palm oil from members of the Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil (rspo.org), 
						which has strict standards that protect forests, wildlife, and indigenous people while 
						minimizing pollution and providing fair working conditions and wages to farmers. Every 
						ounce of oil is traceable to the farm where it was grown. Woodberry is dedicated to 
						palm oil as a high-quality ingredient and to ensuring every drop is sustainably and 
						ethically produced.				
					</p>
					</details>
				</li>		
				<li>
					<details>
					<summary><span>Free of Sulfate, Phthalate, Paraben, and Detergent</span></summary>
					<p>What is this stuff anyway? These harmful chemicals have no place in good soap, 
						which is why you won’t find them at Chiave Essentials.
					</p>
